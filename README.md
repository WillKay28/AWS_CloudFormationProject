# AWS_CloudFormationProject
In this project, I implement AWS Infrastructure with an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) service CloudFormation.

# Overview 
1. I create an EC2 Linux Instance
2. I attach security groups (firewall) to EC2 Instance & to SSH connections to the instance
3. I also attach an Elastic IP to the EC2 Instance. This ensures that the assigned IPv4 remains permanent over some time.
